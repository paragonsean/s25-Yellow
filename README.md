# Info on Next.js
This project is built using Next.js. React by itself is nothing but a JavaScript library. We need a framework to build our web application.  We can either use create-react-app (CRA) or Next.js as our framework. CRA is no longer maintained, however, Next.js has regular patches and updates. Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing; it is very helpful.

Next.js has the same syntax as React.

# To run / modify this code: 
Follow these steps to run or modify the code:
 - Download & install Node.js (v22.13.1 or v20.18.2 highly recommended)
 - Clone the repository
 - Open the 'wisetraveler' folder in Visual Studio Code.  Do not just open the 's25-Yellow' folder.  You must open the 'wisetraveler' folder. 
 - Using a terminal, install Dependencies using the command: `npm install`
 - Using a terminal, start the development server using the command: `npm run dev`
 - Click the link 'http://localhost:3000' to see live edits
 - After you are done editing the code, ensure that you push the edits to the repo

# Workflow Recommendations
- Always run npm install after pulling updates from the repo
If someone else has added or updated a dependency, running git pull will not automatically update your local dependencies. To ensure you're using the correct versions, run: `npm install`

 # Helpful info
- Dependencies like Bootstrap or ESLint are managed via npm (Node Package Manager). 
- To add new dependencies, use the following command: `npm install <package-name>`

- Backend developers will have to use RESTful APIs to make HTTP requests to the database, such as GET, POST, or DELETE.
